Knowing that the programming language is $language, your task is to generate a detailed caption for a program.
For instance, consider the following program:
```py
def add(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b

add(42, 12)
```

A possible description could be:

  Define a function that accepts two integers and returns their sum. Call this function with 42 and 12".

Note that a longer program might demand a more detailed description: the description must be sufficient to write an equivalent snippet without further context.

Now consider this code:
```py
$code
```

A suited description is:
